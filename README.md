About the Blinkit Analysis Project
Welcome to my Blinkit Data Analysis Project, where I explored a comprehensive dataset to uncover key business insights using Power BI, Power Query Editor, and DAX. This project focuses on analyzing sales trends, product performance, outlet efficiency, and customer purchasing patterns to drive strategic decision-making.

Key findings include:

Fat Content Analysis: Understanding consumer preference for Low Fat vs. Regular Fat products.
Product Performance: Identifying top-selling and least-selling categories to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
Outlet Analysis: Evaluating sales by outlet size, type, and establishment year to assess business growth and operational efficiency.
Sales Trends & Profitability: Tracking yearly sales performance, peak sales periods, and revenue distribution to improve financial planning.
Through advanced data visualization and analytics, this project provides valuable insights to enhance sales strategies, optimize store operations, and improve overall business performance on the Blinkit platform.
